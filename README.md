## Captcha OCR - Deep Learning

A deep learning-based solution for detecting and classifying digits from CAPTCHA images. This repository provides scripts for dataset preprocessing,model training, evaluation, and inference, using a convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on CAPTCHA images.
## Dataset
In this project im using coco dataset which i have provided from real captchas that you must organize in dataset folder
